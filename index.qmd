The California State Water Resources Control Board ([State Water Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/)) and the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards ([Regional Water Boards](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterboards_map.html)), collectively known as the California Water Boards (Water Boards), are dedicated to a single mission:

> *To preserve, enhance, and restore the quality of California's water resources and drinking water for the protection of the environment, public health, and all beneficial uses, and to ensure proper water resource allocation and efficient use, for the benefit of present and future generations.*

In recent years, the State Water Board has committed to a number of cultural and programmatic changes related to [open data](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/resolutions/2018/rs2018_0032.pdf) and [racial equity](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/racial_equity/). To successfully achieve the open data and equity outcomes we seek, it is crucial that we shift our perspectives, culture, and actions towards open science so that the principles are fully integrated.

[Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) through their [Champions Program](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/), provides a framework for education, integration, and operationalization of open science, equity, communication, and kindness into individual and team collaborations and workflows. Teams that participate in the Champions Program are empowered to evolve and invest in their culture, processes, and workflows so that they can embody the [better science for future us mindset](https://openscapes.github.io/series/mindset.html).

[Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) champions open science practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. By introducing teams to open science tools specifically created to meet modern demands for collaborative data science, Openscapes creates the space for teams to invest in a positive open culture that enables better science in less time.

Starting in 2022, the Water Boards, in partnership with Openscapes, have been hosting annual Champions Cohorts and [intend to continue to scale the Champions Program throughout the organization](https://github.com/CAWaterBoardDataCenter/swrcb-openscapes/blob/main/SWRCB%20Openscapes%20Implementation%20Strategy_202302.pdf).
