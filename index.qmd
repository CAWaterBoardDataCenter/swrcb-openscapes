NMFS Openscapes is a multi-year colloboration between NOAA Fisheries science centers and [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) to provide team-based training in reproducible scientific workflows and platforms. We have had six Openscapes cohorts in 2020-2020 and will have an agency-wide Openscapes 2-month training involving six NOAA science centers plus two regional offices in October to December 2022.

[Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) champions open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. With tools specifically created to meet modern demands for collaborative data science, we help create a positive open culture to enable better science in less time.
