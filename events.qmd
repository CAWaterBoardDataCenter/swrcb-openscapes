## Mentor Co-Working

Mentor Co-working is open to Water Boards Staff that have already engaged in Openscapes at the Water Boards in some way and are eligible to be a [Community Mentor](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swrcb-openscapes/mentors/mentor_guidance.html#community-mentors). This will be a space for Water Boards Community Mentors to work on tasks together and make steady progress on their Openscapes and/or open science goals. [Water Boards Openscapes Community Mentors can join us by completing this form!](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=JWoY_kl95kGZQQXSKB02weQpB7i2wZhFuGiMTaE8XbhUMEw4SUZZTFZPQkQ5U01CQ1hYVU9STzNIRi4u&route=shorturl)

These are scheduled and facilitated by an Openscapes Lead **every 3rd Wednesday of the month Jan - May 2026. All Co-working sessions will be from 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm.**

Potential topics we are considering for early 2026 co-working include share-outs on communications regarding event planning and documentation.

Here are some other examples of co-working topics or ideas:

-   Share and document stories related to successes / impacts you have experienced by participating in Openscapes at the Water Boards

-   Find a common data / work challenge across mentors and work on solutions together

-   Help develop resources to support communication and engagement around Openscapes activities (e.g., slides, fact sheets, web updates, blog, etc.)

-   Work on your own thing, with friendly accountability and support

-   Screen share, skill share, show & tell for cool skills, tech, resources you think others should know about
