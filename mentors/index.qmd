The Water Boards Openscapes Mentor Community connects and supports local
Open Science leaders to promote a data-driven culture through the
adoption of open science tools and strategies. Together we develop
leadership and coaching skills to help mentors become better local
leaders and to support their Open Science goals for the coming year.

The mentor group is modeled after the [Openscapes Mentors
Framework](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/mentors-framework),
for sustainably scaling technical and social skill-building through
helping people find what is common and working on it together. An
overview of how Openscapes built the Mentors Framework with NASA
Earthdata staff across a dozen data centers is detailed in our preprint:
[The Openscapes Flywheel: A framework for managers to facilitate and
scale inclusive Open science
practices](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/4560/) (Robinson &
Lowndes 2022).

## Benefits of being a Mentor

We support the Mentor Community by helping mentors prioritize time for
their work through open communication of goals and impacts, and by
hosting regular coworking sessions. These dedicated sessions provide
monthly opportunities for mentors to collaborate and make progress on
shared objectives.

Mentors also serve as local representatives for aligned efforts such as
the \[TODO Racial Equity Subcommittee, the Water Quality Division,
etc.\]. In this role, mentors can help design and promote Openscapes
Champions cohorts, lead communication with local leadership, serve as a
point of contact for interested staff, identify local needs, and support
or coordinate teaching resources for their communities.

As Openscapes Mentors, individuals also have the opportunity to grow key
skillsâ€”including facilitation, networking, and the use of collaborative
platforms like GitHub and RStudio.

Additionally, Openscapes Mentors are part of a broader network of peers
with shared goals, including mentors at other government agencies,
non-profits, and academic institutions.
