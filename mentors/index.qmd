The Water Boards Openscapes Mentor Community connects and supports local
Open Science leaders to promote a data-driven culture through the
adoption of open science tools and strategies. Together we develop
leadership and coaching skills to help mentors become better local
leaders and to support their Open Science goals for the coming year.

In addition, the Openscapes Mentors are connected with a broader network
of others with similar goals and with the Openscapes Mentors at other
government agencies, non-profits, and academia.

We help the Mentor Community to help mentors carve out time in part
through open communication of goals and impacts, and through \[TODO
bi-weekly coworking sessions\] for the mentor group, so that they have
dedicated times each month set aside to work on their goals together.
The mentors are also local representatives for aligned efforts like the
\[TODO Racial Equity Subcommittee, the Water Quality Division, etc\].
The mentors help design and promote the Openscapes Champions cohorts
when we lead them, spearhead communication with with their local
leadership, act as a point-person for interested local staff, help
identify local needs, and help communicate, or potentially organize,
teaching resources for their local staff.

The mentor group is modeled after the [Openscapes Mentors
Framework](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/mentors-framework),
for sustainably scaling technical and social skill-building through
helping people find what is common and working on it together. An
overview of how Openscapes built the Mentors Framework with NASA
Earthdata staff across a dozen data centers is detailed in our preprint:
[The Openscapes Flywheel: A framework for managers to facilitate and
scale inclusive Open science
practices](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/4560/) (Robinson &
Lowndes 2022).
