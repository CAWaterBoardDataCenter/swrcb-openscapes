[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) champions open, inclusive practices in environmental and Earth science to help uncover data-intensive solutions faster. They do this through their flagship [Champions mentorship program](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/), as well as through community organizing, training, and coaching, leveraging existing resources from open communities along with their own.

Their [flywheel](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html) shows their approach to engaging, empowering, and amplifying science and research communities in open data science --- how they describe kinder, better science in less time.
