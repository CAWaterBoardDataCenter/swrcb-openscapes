Welcome Water Boards Mentors!

As you begin your Openscapes Mentor journey with the Water Boards - we want to be sure you have the resources you need to help you get started. Below is a non-comprehensive, but hopefully informative guide to onboarding as a mentor at the Water Boards. Please re-reference and contribute to revising this page throughout your time as a Water Boards Openscapes Mentor!

We have four Mentor Seaside Chats focused on onboarding and preparing you to support a Champions Cohort at the Water Boards. Here we detail the concepts, skills, and practices Mentors experienced and experimented with in each Mentor Seaside Chats.

## Call 1 Intro to Openscapes at the Water Boards & Mindset for Mentors

**What does it mean to be a mentor?**

Mentors are critical to the success of each cohort as they support the logistical and behind the scenes work required to facilitate and support teams and individuals within each cohort (e.g. note taking, breakout rooms).

In addition to following the Openscapes Code of Conduct, we encourage and expect our mentors to: **ASK QUESTIONS!** You'll probably have a lot of questions as you settle in - please don't hesitate to ask questions as they come up!

**Contribute to the process!** You're new to the process now, but soon you will be as much an expert as the longer-term instructors. Please speak up, offer suggestions, and feel empowered to add to resources, content, and conversations when opportunities arise.

**Practice active listening and asking powerful questions** - listen fully and deeply when other people are speaking and ask powerful questions to empower people to find their own solutions rather than suggesting ideas of what they should do

**Remember that we're all learning and growing together & you don't have to be an expert to teach** You bring a unique lens, perspective, and lived experience to the program - and we encourage you to share that expertise when that feels comfortable for you

**Say YES to Vulnerability; NO to Shame** Going through and supporting the Openscapes process can feel very vulnerable, and that's OK! Shaming yourself or others for any reason is not acceptable. What's important is that we all stay curious and embrace opportunities for learning and growth so that we can build trust in ourselves and each other.

**Your responsibilities during each Mentors Seaside Chat** will be some combination of:

-   Support Instruction team in agenda review Review and prep slide decks

-   Go through / practice "run of show" for upcoming cohort call

-   Provide feedback, bring up sticking points, etc.

**Your responsibilities during each Cohort Call** will be some combination of:

-   Be present in the space: close your email; update MS Teams status to "do not disturb" Share support during cohort calls (+1, emojis, reactions, etc.)

-   Role model the behaviors we want to see Speak up (give people permission to remind, correct)

-   Support meeting logistics:

    -   Monitor chat

    -   Take notes in the shared doc

    -   Manage breakout rooms

    -   Manage and archive the meeting recording

**Your responsibilities after each Cohort Call** will be some combination of:

-   Draft the previous call's Digest

-   Share the Digest with the Mentor team for review & feedback

-   Post the Digest to Github and SWRCB Teams Channel

## Call 2 Intro to our Openscapes Process

The Water Boards Openscapes Instruction team uses multiple platforms to edit, share, and save documents used for the Openscapes Cohort. Below is an overview of the platforms and their primary uses.

-   **Google (Internal Access):** used for Instruction Team planning and preparing cohorts, agendas, digest and where we keep our running notes for our Cohort Prep

-   **OneDrive (Internal Access):** used for sharing/storing final copies with larger cohorts. Import of documents from Google \> OneDrive done by Openscapes Instructors

-   **Github (Internal or External Access):** used for project management, issues, posting Openscapes Digest. Github settings can be edited to "Private" or Internal (code, data, etc. posted can only by those with access) or "Public" or External (code, data, etc. can be viewed and used by anyone).

**Intro of GitHub and Best Practices:** Github is the main platform the Openscapes Instruction Team uses for project management and posting digests for the Cohort. It's important for Mentors to have some basic skills to navigate and post to GitHub. Some skills we will cover include:

-   Setting up and logging into your GitHub Account

-   What and where things are in GitHub!

**Your tasks before our next Mentors Seaside:**

-   Chat Practice creating an Issue in Github

-   Practice labeling your Issue in Github

## Call 3 Intro to Mentorship in Practice

Mentors are critical to the success of each cohort as they support the logistical and behind the scenes work required to facilitate and support teams and individuals within each cohort (e.g. note taking, breakout rooms). In this call, mentors will continue to learn by doing and practice experiential learning by:

-   Navigating between Google drive, OneDrive, and Github

-   Drafting a cohort call digest using Call 1 and 2 agenda notes

-   Posting the digest as an issue and tagging users in

-   Github Posting a digest in Water Boards Openscapes Team's chat and tagging users

-   Facilitating breaking out rooms

## Call 4 Reflection and Run of show

We will have time during this call to reflect and and review our practiced knowledge and skills, go through a detailed run of show for our upcoming Cohort Call #1, and celebrate our Mentor's journeys so far!

-   Getting closure on a shared experience - individual reflection to notice progress and set goals

-   Sharing challenges - in a space built on trust over time

-   Strategic organizing and planning
