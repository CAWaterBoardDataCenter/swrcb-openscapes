We have five Mentor Calls as a full community. Here we detail the skills
and practices Mentors experienced and experimented with in each Call.

How might you reuse these? Moving from "open science from something I do
alone" to "open science is something I support in others".

## Call 1 Openscapes mindset for mentors

What does it mean to be a mentor? What does Open Science at NMFS mean?

-   **Speaking up/sharing about yourself for 4 minutes** - a challenge
    for some to take up that space, a challenge for others to limit to
    that space.

-   **Keeping on time** - as a speaker and as a timekeeper

-   **Listening: giving space/silence. Not jumping in** - get
    comfortable with discomfort

-   **Live contributing to collaborative google doc** - hear from more
    voices than we could only out loud, both time-wise and due to power
    structures

-   **Learned emoji shortcut** - not frivolous; a way to connect, side
    conversations and encouragement to build relationships

-   **Saw us adjusting time on the fly in the doc and verbally** - open
    facilitation

### Your tasks before next Call

1.  **Seaside Chat:** Organize 1 hour with mentors at your center/office
    (or other people from other centers/offices), to discuss how you
    could improve workflows with open science in your own work, your own
    center, or more broadly. You could also discuss these readings 
2.  **Readings**: Read [Shifting institutional culture to develop
    climate solutions with Open
    Science](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5948/) (2023
    preprint) and [How coaching skills have made us better open data
    science
    mentors](https://openscapes.org/blog/2023-05-17-mentor-coach/) (May
    2023), both coauthored by NMFS Mentors, (and \<20 mins combined). 
3.  **(optional) Attend** **Coworking**. We'll send a recurring calendar
    invite for the weeks between Mentors Calls, Tuesdays, 12:30 - 1:30
    pm PT. ([find your local
    time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=NMFS+Openscapes+Mentors+Coworking&iso=20231024T1230&p1=1050&ah=1)).
    On Oct 24, Eli Holmes will report on PARR and the new 2022 memo and
    changes to our data workflows that are being proposed, and discuss
    how these changes will impact staff. (Eli is the NMFS Public Access
    of Research Results (PARR) representative on the NOAA PARR working
    group.)

## Call 2 Developing strong open and collaborative Communities

What skills can we develop to support each other? What are the elements
of successful open communities? What NOAA & NMFS open science
communities do we like to participate in?

-   **Active listening and asking powerful questions** - coaching to
    empower people to find their own solutions rather than suggesting
    our ideas of what they should do

-   **Vulnerability, yes! Shame, no** - learning and building trust by
    getting curious with each other

-   **Leveraging the experiences of a community** - Kathryn, Ady &
    Christine presenting

-   **You don't have to be an expert to teach** - Christine
    screensharing an efficiency tip she just learned

-   **Sharing open resources for reuse** - slides for 12-minute,
    5-minute, or 1-slide only presentations

-   **Crowdsourcing resources** - a list of NOAA & NMFS communities we
    recommend

-   **Making time for live clarification** - open facilitation 'til we
    all know the plan

-   **Bringing attention to or sharing gratitude for a colleague** -
    coaching kudos and examples of raising people up

    Eli will hold optional Seaside Chats open to any mentors. We'll
    discuss Open Data and Open Science issues affecting NOAA Fisheries.
    Wed, Nov 8, Eli will give a brief update on what is happening at the
    NOAA level re Open Science. We've sent calendar invites.

## Call 3 Experiential learning

We converged on open science challenges topics and people who want to
work together and we learned about and practiced experiential learning.

-   **Pitching ideas** - to connect with colleagues

-   **Listening** - listening to understand, avoiding solutioneering

-   **Asking powerful questions** - often begin with "what", "what
    else?", never yes/no

-   **Breaking down activities into teaching concepts** - identifying
    and letting go of extra topics

-   **Do - Reflect - Apply** - approach to teaching

-   **Time constraints** - how constraints both for planning time and
    teaching time can help determine scope of an activity

    broader plan for NMFS Open Science.

## Call 4 Supporting teams to tackle workflow change through the Champions Program

    might have made the slides -- and iterate them to make them work
    more for you

-   **Presenting with little prep time** - saying things out loud as a
    way to test and iterate

-   **Asking questions and giving feedback** - shaping Champions program
    comms/engagement together. Balancing keeping what works,

## Call 5 Reflections and shaping future plans

Celebrating what you've all accomplished together, and this is just the
beginning!

-   **Getting closure on a shared experience** - individual reflection
    to notice progress and set goals, physical pen & paper for the

    science initiatives

-   **Value of microlearnings and microcommunications** - the idea of
    reusing pieces of the blog post content as microcommunications in
    open science newsletters, as messages to colleagues, or to share in
    a meeting

    people\'s work and giving credit by directly reading rather than
    summarizing
