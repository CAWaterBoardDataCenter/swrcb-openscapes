During that time they will attend mandatory Cohort Calls and Seaside Chats, and may also attend optional Co-working Sessions.\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes cohort process above shows the estimated weekly and overall time commitment each individual in the cohort will dedicate to Openscapes tasks.\n\n\nCohort Calls are mandatory 2-hour meetings where the bulk of content is delivered to all teams in the Cohort. The topics covered during lessons include: the Openscapes mindset, team culture, GitHub, as well as data, documentation and workflow strategies for “future us”. Openscapes publishes the lessons for each meeting. However, the Water Boards Openscapes Team has customized content and the order of topics in each Cohort Call to better serve the current Water Boards framework and needs. The specific content, activities, and discussions of each call is different but generally have the following core structure:\n\nRoll call with ice breaker\nWelcome with Code of Conduct reminder\nLesson with activity 1\nLesson with activity 2\nClosing reflections, efficiency and equity tips, and reminders\n\nSeaside Chats are mandatory 1-hour meetings that are scheduled and led by each team. This time is for teams to meet, outside of the full cohort, so that they can reflect on past cohort meetings or prepare for an upcoming cohort meeting. It is a time for the team to share questions they have, follow-up on call topics, and/or work on their shared Pathway Spreadsheet.\nCo-working Sessions are optional 1-hour meetings that are scheduled by the Water Boards Openscapes Team. This is a time for individuals and teams to come together outside of the formal Cohort Calls and Seaside Chats to practice building and implementing skills and principles that are discussed during the Cohort Calls.\nIt is also highly recommended that individuals allocate approximately 1 hour per week to individual reflection and work related to the Openscapes process.\nThe aggregate time participants will need to commit to the Cohort Process comes out to approximately 2-4 hours per week, depending on whether they take part in optional Co-working Sessions and how Cohort Calls and Seaside Chats fall on their calendars."

    "section": "Context",
    "text": "Context\nOver the last decade, there have been rapid changes within the scientific community to improve the quality of science – these advances are not related to specific methodologies, but largely around scientific culture and collaboration (collectively, ‘Open Science’). Many of the techniques – including version control, code review, reproducible reports, project management, and leadership skills – have been widely used by industry and academic partners, but have not seen wide use in government. Open Science fosters a more efficient and equitable working environment, via improved team collaboration and knowledge sharing.\nIn recent years, the State Water Board has committed to a number of cultural and programmatic changes related to open data and racial equity. To date, the implementation and integration of open data principles throughout the Water Boards has come from a largely technical perspective with a focus on making process, data, code, publications, etc. more transparent, open, and accessible on websites like the California Open Data Portal, databases, or GitHub repositories. Implementation and operationalization of equity throughout the Water Boards has only just begun and, thus far, has focused on education and normalization of concepts related to equity. To successfully achieve the open data and equity outcomes we seek, it is crucial that we shift our perspectives, culture, and actions towards open science so that the principles of open data and equity are fully integrated."

    "text": "Why Openscapes?\nThe Water Boards have regulatory responsibility for protecting the water quality of nearly 1.6 million acres of lakes, 1.3 million acres of bays and estuaries, 211,000 miles of rivers and streams, and about 1,100 miles of exquisite California coastline.\nThe Water Board is committed to leading the state in promotion of openness and interoperability of water data. Ensuring information is accessible, discoverable, and usable by the public will foster entrepreneurship, innovation, and scientific discovery. The Water Board is also committed to advancing racial equity and is actively working toward a future where race no longer predicts a person’s access to water or the quality of water resources they receive, where race does not predict professional outcomes for our employees, and where we consistently consider racial equity impacts before we make decisions.\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. They approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. Data analysis and stewardship are entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. The Openscapes Framework is team-based and particularly suited to the type of team projects that we work on.\nOpenscapes, through their Champions Program, provides a framework for education, integration, and operationalization of open science, equity, communication, and kindness into individual and team collaborations and workflows. Teams that participate in the Champions Program are empowered to evolve and invest in their culture, processes, and workflows so that they can embody the better science for future us mindset. The scaling of the Openscapes Champions Program throughout the Water Boards is helping our teams change their scientific and programmatic workflows to work more openly, reproducibly, efficiently and robustly, to advance the Water Boards’ mission."

    "section": "Where we are now",
    "text": "Where we are now\nMany state and federal agencies, including the Water Boards, are experiencing a number of pressures affecting agency science. Examples include:\n\nNew risks affecting the kind of science we do (climate change impacts - like drought, floods, and fires - on freshwater and marine ecosystems and public health) and requiring new analyses to deal with changing environments\nFlat budgets amid rising operation costs and increasing costs of living (employees that leave may not be replaced)\nA distributed workforce (employees based remotely or across multiple offices)\nAn aging workforce, associated risk of loss of data and institutional knowledge, and need for succession planning\nNeed for transparency to enhance public trust in agency science and decisions\n\nMany Water Boards Divisions, Regions, Offices, and Programs are doing their best to implement these actions into their work. However, implementation to date has been somewhat separate, meaning some people work on implementing principles of open data while others work on implementing principles of equity. While limited staff bandwidth and resources are undoubtedly key contributors to this trend, it is also largely due to a lack of training, education, and guidance on how these principles and plans are integrated and inextricably linked to one another.\nThere is an urgent need to upskill the existing Water Boards workforce with modern tooling and collaborative approaches to help our agency be nimble and tackle the challenges of the 21st century. Doing so will increase efficiency, effectiveness, and build enduring resilience across Water Boards Divisions, Regions, Offices, and Programs.\nChange requires both structure and flexibility, focused on inclusion and empathy, so we can elevate our peers from where they are. Similarly, collaborative team-based research requires non-technical changes to the way we work; these include documenting standard operating procedures, working inclusively within/across science centers and regional offices, and cultivating rather than reinventing products. Supporting this change in work culture demands a dynamic approach that leverages and amplifies ongoing work in global Open Science - and that is what Openscapes does, based on their team’s transition to better science in less time."

    "text": "What we’ve done\nIn 2021, two staff from the Water Board’s Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA) were assigned to serve as mentors for two Openscapes Cohorts: Fisheries Dependent Data Users (FDD) and NOAA’s National Marine Fishery Service (NMFS) Champions Cohorts. During this time, OIMA staff were tasked with learning more about the Openscapes Champions Program and determining whether and how we could bring the Openscapes mindset and process to the Water Boards and our diverse network of partners and collaborators.\nIn 2022, we wanted to share what we learned and the Openscapes Champions Program as a whole with the Water Boards and our partners. We wanted to explore whether the Champions Program could realistically be scaled throughout the Water Boards given the workforce’s limited bandwidth (available time and resources). So, we worked with the Openscapes team to plan and execute a Champions Cohort at the Water Boards. While cohorts are typically led by the Openscapes team, this was the first to be led by Openscapes mentors and the first Champions Cohort at a US state government agency. To learn more about other previous cohorts, explore the Openscapes Champions Cohorts List.\nThe 2022 Water Boards Champions cohort (2022-swrcb) was developed to intentionally customize the Champions Program to better serve our current organizational framework and needs. This included working with managers from OIMA and the Division of Water Quality (DWQ) to select teams for the pilot, and customizing meeting length, structure, and content to center culture, equity, and the importance and benefits of documentation, and to give teams more time to dive into and discuss these topics."

    "text": "Cohort Instructors: Corey Clatterbuck (OIMA), Anna Holder (OIMA)\nCohort Mentors: Devan Burke (OIMA), Tina Ures (DWQ)\nGuest Teachers: Julia Stewart Lowndes (Openscapes), Ileana Fenwick (UNC Chapel Hill)\n\nCohort Webpage\nBlog Post\n\nIn mid-August-mid-October 2022, the Water Boards cohort instructors and mentors led the first Openscapes Champions Cohort at the Water Boards. While cohorts are typically led by the Openscapes team, this was the first to be led by former Openscapes mentors and the first Champions Cohort at a US state government agency. Because we were piloting the program, only 3 teams participated in the process:\n\nThe PFAS Free Team was a cross-unit project team within the Water Board Division of Water Quality.\nThe SWAMP Team was a unit within the Water Board Office of Information Management and Analysis.\nThe Performance Report Team was a project team within the Water Board Office of Information Management and Analysis.\n\nNormalizing language, process, and changing behaviors and actions to support more open and equitable workflows and mindsets can be a challenging shift for teams. Despite these challenges, the post-cohort survey suggested that ultimately, Openscapes did help individuals adopt an open mindset towards their work, their teams, and themselves - and that teams are now evolving their processes, behaviors, and actions to be more open, inclusive, and kind!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant quotes from the post-cohort survey\n\n\n\n“It has been a great opportunity for me to slow down and take the time to evaluate / check-in on my work and team workflow / processes. Many of the things we discussed are totally in line with my personal philosophies / approaches but I haven’t really put time into thinking about how to establish those things through documentation. I tend to be an individual worker bee and appreciate the co-working concepts and getting more comfortable in that shared space to do work!”\n“How important it is to…give people the space to work and try new things. I think I’ve better internalized that it’s okay to share imperfect work.”\n“Now that more staff have been exposed to the Openscapes principles, I think I will be more comfortable suggesting the use of tools like Git / GitHub and code-based workflows. In general, I will also be more comfortable suggesting that we use better project management practices and think about things like documentation / reproducibility as fundamental parts of our work, and not just make those an afterthought.”"

    "text": "The Openscapes Champions Program is a remote-by-design, cohort-based mentorship program that supports teams of up to 6 colleagues to re-imagine data analysis and stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive communities. Teams will focus on their own work with their teams to identify where they are and where they want to go. It’s important to note that individuals and teams do not have to have familiarity or expertise in open science or data science fields to benefit from the Openscapes Champions Program.\nLogistically, teams who apply to the 2023 cohort can be comprised of:\n\n3-6 people;\nAnyone across all Water Boards BDOs, regions, and job classifications;\nSome team members external to the Water Boards, as long as these team members also fit the characteristics described below.\n\nCharacteristics of teams that will get the most return on their investment into the Champions Program include:\n\nTeam members are given the approval and support they need from their management to dedicate the time required to actively participate and engage in the Openscapes Process. The minimum and required time commitment is 2-4 hours/week over 10 weeks for meetings and associated work. For more information, see the cohort process section of the Implementation Cycle.\nTeams that have at least one or two members who do some form of data management, analysis, visualization, or communication in their work on a regular basis. The more regular this work occurs (e.g. weekly is better than quarterly), and the more technically advanced they are (e.g. coding in R, Python or SQL is better than Excel), the more the entire team will get out of the process.\nAll team members are interested in exploring the interconnected nature of open science and in taking time to reimagine data workflows and stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative, inclusive, equitable, and kind teams and communities.\nTeams want to evolve and invest in their culture, processes, and workflows so that they can embody the better science for future us mindset.\n\n“Better science” means science that is more open, reproducible, efficient, and also more diverse, equitable, inclusive, kind.\n“Future us” is ourselves, teams, communities in the next hour, week, decades – with a focus on onboarding ourselves and others to ongoing work."
