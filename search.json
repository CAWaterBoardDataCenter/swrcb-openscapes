It was exciting to see participants discuss common pain points and learn from each other about strategies that could be reused across centers. Discussion topics included strategies to help diverse teams develop strategies for using GitHub together and organizing R code, as well as articulating differences between final NOAA products vs ongoing work/projects and how open science relates to both.\nMany topics/themes that resonated with the 2021 NOAA NMFS Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. Here are a few examples:\nDocumenting onboarding & offboarding processes. Investing time to formally document onboarding and offboarding processes (for federal employees as well as contractors) was a big topic. Both are important to capture institutional knowledge and critical to prepare both for folks leaving their positions and for new folks joining the team. Written documents help others get up to speed faster, and find available datasets, data description guides, and methodologies. It’s critical that they are easily accessible and updatable “living documents” for core or team processes that may occur infrequently.\nGitHub projects. While multiple tools for project collaboration and management exist, this cohort was particularly enthusiastic to learn more about Github projects. The cohort noticed that Github projects are easily used by team members who have different skill sets, job titles, and areas of expertise. Teams started offering other ways to contribute, including discussion boards, Github issues, and Slack. These tools enable asynchronous collaboration that goes “beyond the meetings” and can improve hybrid working conditions. GitHub’s Project Boards{beta} were release just as our cohort ended and Paul McElhaney (NWFSC) shared examples of how it could be used by NOAA teams. Some potential uses for GitHub Projects included:\nStrategies for community building. Collaboration is essential within teams and with external partners, but collaborating with people around new technology is challenging and takes time. Discussing next steps for carrying this work forward, one participant summarized it as “not just skills, also culture”, and that helping folks get excited is worth the effort. Strategies included show-by-doing (screensharing), co-working, office hours, and bringing down silos of people who are used to working with (beyond job titles). This includes sharing work earlier (not waiting for work to be perfect-ish before sharing) and building better shared relationships with Google folders."

This cohort training took place over 5 remote calls from January 28 to March 11, 2022. Cohort calls covered: 1) setting the open science mindset and discussing psychological safety, 2) an introduction to publishing and project management on GitHub, 3) instituting team culture and data strategies, 4) developing open communities and coding strategies, and 5) preparing a team pathway document to guide their open data science journey after the training.\nThe teams focussed their energy on a range of important research issues supporting the AFSC mission including shellfish, fisheries, marine mammals, stock assessments, ecosystem indicators, trophic relationships, and food habits. The teams consisted of 41 AFSC employees from 5 AFSC divisions and the Alaska Regional Office. All of the teams developed their skills for analysis workflows, report writing and manuscript preparation, promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration, intentional investment in on- and off-boarding processes, better collaboration with academic and state governments, and integrated project management. All of this was achieved within the context of a growing expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community.\nFor each of the teams, the Openscapes training was just the beginning of a longer process. It is essential that AFSC leadership, division directors, and supervisors continue to offer the support, time, space, and enthusiasm as teams continue to develop skills and implement meaningful new practices. Participants in the training also recognize the need for additional training in specific skills and technologies (e.g., R, Python, Git and GitHub, advanced Google Workspace, reproducible analysis, collaborative writing). The AFSC can provide support for these needs by both identifying and funding training opportunities, and by encouraging scientists to allocate work time for expanding knowledge and expertise through free resources and self-directed training.\nParticipants from the AFSC Openscapes cohort found the training transformative for their professional development. The training created a supportive forum for continued learning and collaboration across programs and divisions. As mentors for the AFSC Openscapes cohort we are committed to the community of support and active learning environment established during the training. We feel confident in stating AFSC’s continued investment in Openscapes will establish AFSC scientists as leaders in open science, enhance collaborations across divisions and centers, ensure continuity of long-term research efforts, and improve scientific communication to all stakeholders. Everyone involved in the cohort looks forward to expanded Openscapes training opportunities in the near future.\nOpenscapes blog post"

    "text": "Teams and their achievements\nThe EcoFOCI Ecosystem Indicators Team Aimed to streamline, document, and standardize survey data analysis and annual reporting of EcoFOCI ecosystem indicators for ESRs and ESPs. Before openscapes, the team felt that tight timelines forced the team to work “quickly; not always carefully” and that the Openscapes training gave them space to explore easier, faster, and more consistent ways to prepare results. They created a GitHub organization to help them codify data and code, and more importantly, invest in culture change. The team heavily discussed establishing a culture of modeling openness, sharing early code, and asking for expertise. The team aptly phrased the latter as “hidden expertise,” as the expertise may exist, but on local computers and unbeknownst to their peers, forcing others to reinvent workflows and processes that were already established.\n\n\n\nEcoFOCI diagram\n\n\nThe Marine Mammal Stock Assessments Team aimed to streamline the development, review, and publication of the annual Alaska marine mammal stock assessment reports. They used GitHub, a new GitHub organization, wikis, and R Markdown to establish processes for preparing data and analyses, tackle outdated version control workflows, and improve on and offboarding procedures. The team focused on developing one SAR in R Markdown as a proof of concept. The team found that seaside chats spurred open discussion and idea sharing and has continued to meet regularly after Openscapes.\nThe Groundfish Food Habits Team was focused on streamlining reproducible flow of code and data to provide food habits and model data to ESRs, ESPs, and stock assessments. The team found that writing out the pathways document helped confirm next overarching steps for the group, that there were changes that needed to happen in their workflow, and that they needed to establish best practices. In an effort to foster a culture of reuse, the team started and tested out a GitHub organization and other avenues for collaboration so they can find the best platform forward for their unique team’s needs.\nThe Shellfish Assessment Program Team was focused on 1) improving their annual Tech Memo and 2) improving collaboration on bitter crab disease reports. Through the Openscapes program, the team devised a plan for accessing raw data, to data wrangling, to preparing tech memo figures. With their new GitHub organization, they had the tools to start earnest discussions on how to document their work.\nThe AFSC Stock Assessment Team’s overarching goals were to 1) create reproducible stock assessments and streamline reporting and presenting to Council bodies (specific project could be to take two assessments as examples: arrowtooth flounder and northern rockfish), 2) improve data to modeling to reporting for economic models, 3) create consistent fishery data sources across science and management, and 4) discuss of CFI implementation. They developed the Stock Modeling and Assessment Reproducibility Team (SMART), a supporting SOP, and a GitHub organization. SMART combines the two stock assessment teams and coordinates regular meetings and overarching goals for the effort.\nThe Trophic Roles of Ice Seals RWP Team aimed to develop a new Regional Work Plan-funded project to estimate the consumption of dominant prey by ice-associated seals in the Bering and Chukchi seas that would involve collaborators within and beyond NOAA. The team felt that Openscapes created a space for members to collect thoughts, define a more efficient and thoughtful workflow ecosystem (e.g., tidyverse) to work within, and start planning how they can share what they learned and hope to implement with their larger group. The team worked on how their new GitHub Organization could help them work with external collaborators and instill version control as projects evolve. The team felt that working though this example project provided them with a universal framework that can be transferred to other existing projects.\nThe Fisheries Monitoring Team was focused on improving the Annual Deployment Plan analytic and report production workflow and result sharing with council, stock assessors and the public. Galvanized by Openscapes’ GitHub tutorial and an endeavor to streamline the onboarding and offboarding process, the team has begun moving much of their dataset wrangling scripts and issue tracking to GitHub. The team has also begun developing standard datasets for everyone to use in easy to access locations.\nThe Midwater Pollock Assessment Team aimed to create a reproducible and transparent abundance analysis and reporting process for the management of midwater walleye pollock data in Alaska. This team used their time with Openscapes to explore the best project management platform for their team and survey preparation, realizing that trello and smartsheets gave the team the flexibility they needed. The team also began automating cruise reports with R Markdown. The team next plans on providing a demonstration and presentation to the rest of their larger group as they start planning for their summer survey."

    "text": "Cohort Webpage\nBlog Post\nFay Lab Manual Project of one of the teams. Widely used now as an example of a ‘Code of Conduct’ and on-boarding document for a team.\n\nIn September-October 2021, Openscapes led a 2-month Champions Cohort with Fisheries Dependent Data (FDD) Users, with over 30 fisheries scientists across academia and NOAA. These scientists were interested in exploring new approaches to working with FDD, which represents a complex mix of data and information collected to facilitate managing the region’s living marine resources. In the US Northeast, data flow from individual businesses and/or scientific samplers to the region’s scientific and management organizations. This web of data and information can be difficult to access as much of the content is confidential in its raw form. Further, many of the codes and systems used to store these data can be poorly documented, and even routine analyses are not commonly shared among data users. The FDD Openscapes Cohort was interested in learning ways to explore the potential to leverage FDD in new and innovative ways. It was part of ongoing efforts to provide access, documentation, and cultivate a community of practice that focuses on using these data and associated resources to their full potential.\n\nWhat did the participants achieve?\nfrom the Openscapes blog post\nThis was an exciting cohort because participants were focused on a common topic: research using FDD data. We had both data users (largely academic) and data providers (NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center) in the Cohort, and they were able to share common issues and approaches that could benefit others in the group. Many topics/themes that resonated with the 2021 FDD Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. Here are a few examples.\nSharing data isn’t the only way to practice open science. Many aspects of FDD can be confidential, meaning that it cannot be shared publicly or has special considerations for sharing. We discussed how there are ways to be open and collaborative even if you can’t share the data itself. For example, sharing documentation and metadata is a way to be open and collaborative, even if you cannot share the data. Making knitted (RMarkdown) documents that show data summaries even when raw data can’t be accessed is another strategy. Another approach is to provide a “toy” or simulated dataset with all the right fields so that code can be developed, then shared with a partner who has access to the confidential data and can run the code on their own. Further, location data can be jittered, vessel IDs can be anonymized, and data can be collapsed or summarized in a way to protect the confidential aspects of the dataset before sharing it broadly. We also discussed different definitions and examples of confidential data, and how folks treat it differently within an agency, and outwardly for users. Do we all agree on what confidential data actually is? Does everyone know how to handle confidential data properly?\nPsychological safety. When we discussed the importance of psychological safety, participants had great ideas for how to help foster more trust and safety in teams. For example, instead of “do you have any questions?” asking “what questions do you have?”, and creating spaces where individuals can be vulnerable to role model and encourage group vulnerability and trust. The cohort emphasized and reiterated that building trust and vulnerability takes time; it is built/earned through little moments and actions, not given outright - and it’s important for those that hold power (PIs, supervisors, managers, etc.) to lead by example and make space for those little moments within their teams. Others noted how important psychological safety was in this area where often data sets are not well documented and communication is essential to the proper use of the data.\nTooling helped teams collaborate - but Github and Slack are not the only options! Utilizing tools like Slack and GitHub can help some teams streamline and advance their communication and collaboration workflows, but that doesn’t mean those specific tools will work for everyone. Some individuals and teams in the FDD Cohort were already avid R/GitHub users, others were interested in using those tools more (GitHub Projects, and Issues, anyone?), and some individuals were not as keen on embedding a whole new software like GitHub or Slack into their workflows. Regardless of any individual’s interest or current abilities with a certain tool, everyone was able to use the Openscapes mindset to think about tools and workflows they currently use, explore how they are serving their teams (or not), and brainstorm ways to improve their data and communication workflows independent of any specific tool. Some teams in the FDD cohort regularly work with partners that may not have access to such tools, or even have access to the Internet. Teams began to discuss what to do in those situations and used their Seaside Chats to brainstorm and find solutions that work for them.\nCode of Conduct for Data? In our final session one group shared that with their Pathway they had thought a lot about codes of conduct, and how they could be used to be more clear about how to work with data, data access, and acknowledging contributors across multiple institutions. Other groups agreed, thinking that this could be another form of metadata that would be very helpful to refer to before, during, and after the project. It could also help streamline onboarding of team members as they enter projects, and offboarding team members before they move on. The question of “Who owns the data?”, from principles of anti-colonial science, was an important framing, and folks recommended viewing the recording of Dr. Max Liboiron’s recent keynote about research, communication, and land relations.\n\n\nFDD Cohort teams\nSee the Cohort Webpage"

    "text": "In recent years, the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) completed a functional realignment. New divisons, branches, and matixed teams have been established, giving rise to unique opportunities for redefining work culture and workflows.\nThere are 36 people from SEFSC and 4 people from AOML participating in the 2022 SEFSC Summer Cohort of the Openscapes Champions training program. This includes 5 people who previously participated in the Fall 2021 NMFS Cohort who are now helping to lead teams in the current cohort. There are 9 supervisors participating, 8 from SEFSC and 1 from AOML. Within SEFSC, there’s a large group from the Sustainable Fisheries Division, with 100% of staff from 3 branches: Caribbean, Gulf, and Data Analysis & Assessment Support. There are 4 SEFSC participants from Operations, Management and Information, who will strengthen their own workflows while gaining an increased understanding of current (and future) science workflows at SEFSC.\nThis cohort training is taking place over 5 remote calls from June 30 to August 25, 2022. Cohort calls will cover:\n\nsetting the open science mindset and discussing psychological safety,\nan introduction to publishing and project management on GitHub,\ninstituting team culture and data strategies,\ndeveloping open communities and coding strategies, and\npreparing a team pathway document to guide their open data science journey after the training.\n\nIn direct alignment with SEFSC strategic initiatives, the Summer SEFS Openscapes cohort is advancing innovation and operational best practice processes. The teams are focusing their energy on a range of important research issue while developing their skills to cultivate innovation and establish best practices in their own work. All of this is achieved within the context of a growing expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community.\nSEFSC Openscapes Summer 2022 planning team: Adyan Rios;, Molly Stevens, James Primrose, Erica Rule.\n\nTeams\nThe Advanced Technology Team\nThe Biology and Life History Team\nThe Caribbean Team\nThe Data Analysis and Assessment Support Team\nThe IEA Team\nThe Assessment Workflow Team\nThe Data Governance Team\nThe Data Workflows and Project Management Team\nThe Fisheries Statistics Team\n\n\nContinued support\nAt the conclusion of the training, cohort members are encouraged to share their hopes for how the SEFSC will continue to support and enhance open data science within our community.

    "text": "A plan to modernize NMFS teams with Open Science\n\nContext\nOver the last decade, there have been rapid changes within the scientific community to improve the quality of science – these advances are not related to specific methodologies, but largely around scientific culture and collaboration (collectively, ‘Open Science’). Many of the techniques – including version control, code review, reproducible reports, project management, and leadership skills – have been widely used by industry and academic partners, but have not seen wide use in government. Open Science fosters a more efficient and equitable working environment, via improved team collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n\nWhere we are today\nMany federal agencies, including NOAA Fisheries, are experiencing a number of pressures affecting agency science. Examples include:\n\nNew risks affecting the kind of science we do (climate change impacts on freshwater and marine ecosystems) and requiring new analyses to deal with changing environments\nFlat budgets amid rising operation costs and increasing costs of living (employees that leave may not be replaced)\nA distributed workforce (employees based remotely or across multiple offices)\nAn aging workforce, associated risk of loss of data and institutional knowledge, and need for succession planning\nNeed for transparency to enhance public trust in agency science and decisions\n\n\n\nOur vision for the future\nA number of projects across NMFS science centers have adopted Open Science practices to improve the efficiency and quality of scientific products. Examples include the development of FIMS tools for next generation stock assessment, the joint NMFS - DFO stock assessment of Pacific hake (NWFSC), ecosystem status reports for the Mid-Atlantic and New England Fishery Management Councils (NEFSC), and data products related to surveys (AFSC). Many additional projects are also deployed on the NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox (FIT).\nDespite these advancements, applications of Open Science best practices within NMFS are generally program-specific and maintained by one or a few team members. There is an urgent need to upskill the existing NMFS workforce with modern tooling and collaborative approaches to help our agency be nimble and tackle the challenges of the 21st century. Doing so will increase efficiency and build enduring resilience across science centers and regional offices.\nChange requires both structure and flexibility, focused on inclusion and empathy, so we can elevate our peers from where they are. Similarly, collaborative team-based research requires non-technical changes to the way we work; these include documenting standard operating procedures, working inclusively within/across science centers and regional offices, and cultivating rather than reinventing products. Supporting this change in work culture demands a dynamic approach that leverages and amplifies ongoing work in global Open Science - and that is what Openscapes does, based on their team’s transition to better science in less time.\n\n\nWhat we have done and where we are going\nSince 2020, individual science centers have organized 6 cohorts with the Openscapes’ Champions Program (most recently with a 2022 SEFSC Summer Cohort) demonstrating a demand at NMFS. However as not all centers (or regional offices) have access to the same levels of training funds, cohorts have not been evenly distributed across the agency. In addition, the training has thus far been limited to full-time federal staff and at many science centers, teams involve contractors and non-federal collaborators.\nWe are working on securing support for a 3-year national-level program modeled off of the 3-year NASA Openscapes program. Supporting Openscapes at a national level would enable sustainable adoption of Open Science workflows and more efficient NMFS teams trained in modern data science tools and team management.\n\n\nWhy Openscapes?\nNOAA Fisheries is responsible for the stewardship of the nation’s ocean resources and their habitat. We provide vital services for the nation, all backed by sound science and an ecosystem-based approach to management. NOAA promotes Open Science in its work towards its mission: NOAA Data Strategy for open and transparent data and analyses.\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. They approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. Data analysis and stewardship are entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. The Openscapes Framework is team-based and particularly suited to the type of big team projects that we work on. Openscapes training is helping NMFS teams change their scientific workflows to work more openly, reproducibly, efficiently and robustly, to advance NOAA Fisheries’ mission."
