## Champions Cohorts

The Water Boards Openscapes Champions Program is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for individuals and teams at the Water Boards.

### Current and Upcoming Cohorts

[**2023 Water Boards Cohort**](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swrcb-openscapes/cohorts/swrcb_2023.html)**:** From mid-August through mid-October 2023, the Water Boards will host a Champions Cohort, which will include 6 teams of no more than 6 individuals per team.

Water Boards teams were able to apply for this opportunity from 2 May - 30 June 2023. The Water Boards Openscapes Team offered to present about this work and its future in our organization to management, internal roundtables, and work groups, starting in February 2023 (see [presentation list](https://github.com/CAWaterBoardDataCenter/swrcb-openscapes/issues/15)). To request a presentation for your RT, group, or team, please email [Anna Holder](mailto:anna.holder@waterboards.ca.gov).

### Past Cohorts

[2022 Water Boards Cohort](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swrcb-openscapes/cohorts/swrcb_2022.html): From mid-August through mid-October 2022, the Water Boards led the first Openscapes Champions Cohort at the Water Boards. Because we were piloting the program, only 3 teams participated in the process.
