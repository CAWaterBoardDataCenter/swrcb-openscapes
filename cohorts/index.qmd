## Champions Cohorts

NMFS Openscapes Champions program is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for individuals and research teams in NOAA Fisheries. Read [blog posts](https://www.openscapes.org/tags/noaa-fisheries/) about each NMFS Champions Cohort and other NMFS Openscapes activities.


## Current and Upcoming Cohorts

**4 Fall NMFS Champions Cohorts** are happening concurrently during Oct-Dec 2022,  at AFSC, NWFSC, SWFSC, and SEFSC with participation by PIFSC, NEFSC, OST, and WCRO staff. 

This Fall, quite a few teams want to make progress on automating government reports. Specific work using R/RMarkdown/Quarto, GitHub, and hopefully Cloud includes: 

- Eli Holmes is organizing a NWFSC/WCRO/SWFSC group to discuss changes to the Salmonid Viability Reports which the West Coast region uses for 5-year Status Reviews (among other things)
- Josh London is working on creating templates for HTML versions of NMFS reports. So far he is working on marine mammal assessment reports but what he is doing can be generalized.
- Eli Holmes is working on the PDF output side and learning how to make Quarto extensions.
- Rmd to 508 Compliant Word experience 
- A barrier that often surfaces is it is difficult for non-coders to work from RStudio; the installation part is too much of a hurdle, IT is required, and it's a lot of trouble to only edit. We're exploring Cloud to assist here.
