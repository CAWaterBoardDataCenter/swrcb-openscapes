## Participant quotes from the post-cohort survey

"So grateful to get an **invaluable experience** like this so early in my career, I'll definitely bring these lessons (and this community!) with me no matter where I end up :)"

"**I imagine incorporating many of the concepts into work moving forward**, slowing down to speed up, documenting our work process for future us, and creating safe space for ideas and growth."

"**The categories and topics \[in the Pathway\] were helpful to prompt our group's thinking.** For example, we started out discussing data and then realized, wow team culture and communication is something we haven't thought about directly!"
