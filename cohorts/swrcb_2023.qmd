## Participant quotes from the post-cohort survey

“Normally, I really am resistant to types of trainings and seminars about abstract concepts of the way of work. It feels really intangible and false, kind of like corporate nonsense. ***But this program was the opposite of that.*** It was applied. ***It was by people like me for people like me**.*”

“Openscapes is one of few experiences beyond university that have been so organized, structured, guided, and constructive in **developing my collaboration skills**.”

“The biggest impact is to have the [vulnerability]{.underline} to present incomplete or in-process work in order to get the most out of collaboration. I'm hesitant to share messy work product, but this program has shown me the [**benefit of bringing others in when it's messy**]{.underline}, and how that helps.”
