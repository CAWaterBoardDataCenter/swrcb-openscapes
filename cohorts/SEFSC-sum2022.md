# Summary
SEFSC supported XX teams from across the center in the 2022 Summer Openscapes Cohort of the Openscapes Champions training program. This cohort training is taking place over 5 remote calls from June 30 to August 25, 2022. Cohort calls will cover: 

1) setting the open science mindset and discussing psychological safety, 
2) an introduction to publishing and project management on GitHub, 
3) instituting team culture and data strategies, 
4) developing open communities and coding strategies, and 
5) preparing a team pathway document to guide their open data science journey after the training. 

The teams are focusing their energy on a range of important research issues supporting the SEFSC mission including... The teams consist of 37 SEFSC employees across 7 SEFSC divisions, along with 4 employees from AOML. All of the teams are developing their skills to cultivate innovation and establish best practices in their own work.  All of this is achieved within the context of a growing expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community.
